		In the past few years of attending Embry-Riddle, one of the most important things I’ve realized and have gained a better understanding 
		of is the importance of the people you put yourself around. These relationships that you develop with others can prove to have a lot of 
		influence during your college career. One thing I struggled with at the beginning of studying at Riddle is finding that right group of 
		friends to associate with. Friends who I can enjoy being around, open to what I have to say, and being there when I need help with anything. 
		It took me awhile to find these kinds of friends, and being introverted certainly didn’t help with that. I remember attending a local church 
		for quite a few months and being too shy to talk with any of the college students there. I knew where most of them sat during the service, 
		but I was too shy to sit with them or go over to them after the service. But I thank God for how He orchestrated and arranged my encounters 
		with some of these college students. In the past two years, I’ve developed some amazing friendships who give encouragement when things get 
		rough, who put others before themselves, and who gives me wisdom in certain areas of my life, especially with my relationship with Jesus Christ.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		I believe that we are created to be relational with one another. I believe God has designed us that way so that we can have these strong 
		relationships in our lives, and have an even stronger relationship with Jesus. A story from the Bible that is an excellent example of this 
		kind of community is in Mark 2:1-12 (NLT). 
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		“When Jesus returned to Capernaum several days later, the news spread quickly that he was back home. Soon the house where he was staying was so
		packed with visitors that there was no more room, even outside the door. While he was preaching God’s word to them, four men arrived 
		carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. They couldn’t bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they dug a hole through the roof above his 
		head. Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, ‘My child 
		your sins are forgiven.’ But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves, ‘What is he saying? This
		is blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!’ Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, so he asked them, ‘Why do you question this in 
		your hearts? Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or ‘Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk?’ So I will prove
		to you that the Son of Man has the authority on earth to forgive sins.’ Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, ‘Stand up, pick 
		your mat, and go home!’ And the man jumped up, grabbed his mat, and walked out through the stunned onlookers. They were all amazed and
		praised God, exclaiming, ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before!’”
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
		These friends of the paralyzed man are amazing examples of friends that we should strive to be and look for. They are incredibly determined 
		to bring healing to their paralyzed friend and go far out of the way to do so, even climbing to the top of a house and tearing a hole 
		through the roof. And these friends knew exactly what the paralyzed man needed, Jesus Christ. They knew only Jesus could forgive him, 
		heal him, and change his life permanently. This encourages me to have friends like this and to be a friend like this. Imagine how much 
		different our years in college could be if we surrounded ourselves with people who cared this much about us. I believe it could permanently
		change our lives for the better!
