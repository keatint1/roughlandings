		My biggest struggle at Embry-Riddle was being falsely accused of sexual harassment on my Mother's birthday. I was told I created a hostile 
		environment which made me feel like a predator. 
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		I've been told that my kindness and respect for women has been interpreted as I'm making moves on them. This caused tension 
		in my work place because I was under the impression that we were all friends.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I mostly relied on God and my best friend. Who assured me that it wasn't my fault and that the people who accused me have insecurities 
		they haven't dealt with. Unfortunately, I have a habit of resorting to alcohol and marijuana when I don't want to deal with heavy emotional burdens.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I learned that I have to be careful about how I interact with people. That in turn has showed what people actually think about me. I was also moved
		into a room where I was allowed to be more free. That really helped me feel more comfortable in my surroundings. Actually, moving to Doolittle
		from Adam's Hall was the best thing that ever happened. I was way more comfortable and free to do what I wanted. After I spent some time in 
		Doolittle, I began taking notice of how much energy I give out. I was more observant with how I interact with people, always careful about 
		what I say. Unfortunately, I never wanted it to be this way, but I must protect myself from misinterpretation. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		What I can say for others is just to be extremely careful with the people you interact with on campus. You just have to open your eyes.
