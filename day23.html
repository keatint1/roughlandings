		<h3> Rough Landings Day 23: My Rough Landing Made Softer </h3>
		
		
	
			
		
		<p>
		In Judaism, there is almost no focus on the afterlife. There is minimal description of what heaven is like and almost no mention of a hell. 
		The funeral and mourning process is almost all focused on memory and support from the community. When grieving, you are supposed to remember what made 
		your loved one who has passed special. You recount stories of their accomplishments and pleasant memories that you made together. Your community surrounds and 
		supports you to show you that you are not alone in remembering your loved one, but also moving on with your life.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			When my grandmother died, it was my community around me that came together to support my family in our time of need and mourning. We had conversations
			with our clergy about how to cope with grief and how we should proceed with the funeral. We had countless friends and community members visit our home to make 
			sure we were doing alright. We had friends of varying levels of faith and of different faiths from ours come to support us in our time of need.

		<p>
			I know not how G-d may or may not work in our world. I don’t know if there is some invisible hand guiding the world around us or if there is a figure watching
			over us all. When I think of how G-d works, I think of how people can come together to do some amazing things. I was coming in for a rough landing when my
			grandmother passed, but I was fortunate enough to have a network of support soften it for me. When looking for G-d in our daily lives, sometimes we have to
			take action and create an opportunity for G-d to work. We can’t expect to just pray for everything to be taken care of.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So what does Judaism focus on if not the after-life? Life itself. It’s what you do while you’re alive that’s really important for the sake of making the 
			world a better place. I think that’s the most important lesson to be learned from my faith.
